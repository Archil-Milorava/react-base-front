# React front base code written by me 

Hello, with this code you can save much time. This code has 3 most important pages, Landing - just blank landing page, Login and Sign up pages, the pages are build with plain TSX and Tailwin css, which makes you free to add your favourite UI library on top, like ShadCn or Chakra UI (i recommend this two or plain tailwind CSS).

Data is fetched with react query and you will find the code in hooks folder, which has custom hooks for auth.

The config File contains AXIOS config, which ise set perfectly.

Enjoy and save time.
